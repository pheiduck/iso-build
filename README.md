## How to use the ISO file:

1. The z01 and zip file must be combined. <br>
`cat manjaro-cinnamon-21.06-development-210614-linux510.iso.z01 manjaro-cinnamon-21.06-development-210614-linux510.iso.zip > manjaro-cinnamon-21.06-development-210614-linux510.zip`

2. Unzip the combined zip file. <br>
`unzip manjaro-cinnamon-21.06-development-210614-linux510.zip`
```
Archive:  manjaro-cinnamon-21.06-development-210614-linux510.zip
